# Edsger Wybe Dijkstra(1930 - 2002)

He was a Dutch computer scientist, programmer, software engineer, systems scientist, science essayist, and pioneer in computing science.

> Quality, correctness and elegance are what Dijkstra thinks should characterise a computer program.
> Dijkstra received the Turing Award in 1972.
> One of the things I discovered as early as the 1960s is that mathematical elegance is not a question of esthetics, of taste  or fashion but something you can translate into a technical notion.
> The competent programmer is fully aware of the limited size of his own skull. He therefore approaches his task in full humility and avoid clever tricks like the plague. (EWD 340)
> Elegance is not a dispensable luxury but a factor that decides between success and failure. (EWD 1284)
> Computing science is no more about computers that astronomy is about telescopes.
> The Concise Oxford Dictionary gives as one of the meanings of 'elegant' 'ingeniously simple and effective.
> In practice a program is manageable if you make a truly elegant program firstly because it is shorter than most alternatives and consists of discrete parts each of which you can replace by an alternative implementation without influencing the rest of the program.
> Curiously, the most elegant programs are often the most efficient.
