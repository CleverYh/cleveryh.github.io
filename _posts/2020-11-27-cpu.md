# Design Experiment of Single Cycle CPU

***Chen Yuhan, 19335025, chenyh369@mail2.sysu.edu.cn,*** *Teacher: Prof. Guo Xuemei, TAs: Wang Tingwei & Ding Wen, School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, started on Nov.27th and completed on Dec.6th.*

## Purpose

- **Understand the instruction system commonly used in MIPS and master the working principle and logic function realization of the single cycle CPU.**
- **By observing and analyzing the running condition of single cycle CPU, we can further understand it.**

## Devices

- **A PC with Xilinx Vivado 2017.4 and MARS(Mips Assembler and Runtime Simulator) 4.5 installed**
- **Xilinx FPGA BASYS 3 platform**

## Tasks

1. Based on _Xilinx FPGA BASYS 3 experimental platform_, using HDL language (`Verilog HDL` or `VHDL` ) to achieve the design of a single cycle CPU. The single cycle CPU can complete at least 16 MIPS instructions, including at least the following instructions:
   - Support basic memory operations such as `lw`, `sw` instructions
   - Support basic arithmetic logic operations such as `add`, `sub`, `and`, `ori`, `slt`, `addi` instructions
   - Support basic program control such as `beq`, `j` instruction
2. Master the relevant functions of each instruction and output the simulation results for verification.
3. Finally, it is implemented on FGPA, and the ALU calculation results are displayed on the digital tube of the development board.

## Experimental Principle

### Single Cycle CPU

#### Characteristic

The characteristic of single cycle CPU is that __each instruction only needs one clock cycle, and the next instruction is executed after one instruction is executed.__ In this cycle, address update, fetch, decode, execute, memory operation and register operation are completed. Since the address is updated at the _posedge_ of each clock cycle, all operations must be completed before the _posedge_ comes. Except for using a _negedge_, all the operations can only be solved by using combinatorial logic. This brings some difficulties to the manufacture of registers and RAM. And because the time length of each clock cycle must be uniform, __the time length of clock cycle should be determined according to the instruction time with the longest delay, which also limits its execution efficiency.__

The single cycle CPU updates the `PC` at the _posedge_ of each CLK and reads new instructions. No matter how long the instruction is executed, it must be completed before the next _posedge_ comes.

#### Top-level Structure

The figure below shows the top-level implementation of a single cycle CPU. The main devices include `program counter PC`, `program memory`, `register file`, `ALU`, `data memory` and `control unit`.

Generating Bitstream and Memory Configuration file
right click left side `PROGRAM AND DEBUG` -> `Generate Bitstream`, and click `Bitstrseam Settings...`, enable `-bin_file`, apply and quit.
Run `Generate Bitstream`.
Open target, we can see a `xc7a35t_0` device in the `local host`, status _Not Programmed_, right click on it, `Add Configuration Memory Device`, and there comes with a window, in the `Filter`, choose `Manufacturer` is _Spansion_, click `ok`.
Then we can program it with a bin file which we just generated. Attention, the content in the QSPI flash will be overwritten. Before doing this, make sure the Basys3 board is well connected to the PC, and `JP1`, which is on the top right of the Basys3 board, is in _JTAG_ mode / _QSPI_ mode. (I usually work in _QSPI_ mode because it can also support _Program_ and _Download_)
Make sure `JP1` is in _QSPI_ mode, restart the Basys3 board, wait a second, the program will run automatically.

QSPI JTAG USB mode

_Quad SPI flash_ is a _non-volatile_ storage medium. The Basys3 FPGA chip will quickly downloads/configures from _Quad SPI flash_ automatically once it's power on. It is applicable to the final display or demonstration of completed design projects. Quad SPI flash supports repeated download and write. The next write will erase the content of the last write. Only the `.bin/.mcs` file can be downloaded/configured by using _QSPI_.
_JTAG_ communicate with _PC_ via the _micro-USB port_, which is mainly used for downloads, debugs and port probes. This makes the Basys3 can not only get power supply but also download and debug through the _micro-USB port_.
